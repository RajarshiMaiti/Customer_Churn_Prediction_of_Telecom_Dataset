**Project Overview:-**

**Customer Churn Prediction for a Telecom Dataset**

**Introduction**

**Objective:-** Predict customer churn in a telecom dataset using machine learning techniques.

**Importance:-** Churn prediction helps businesses retain customers by identifying potential churners early.

Dataset Overview

Description of the dataset (features, target variable, size, and source).

Data preprocessing steps like missing value handling, encoding, and feature scaling.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Key insights from data visualization and statistical analysis.

Feature distributions, correlations, and patterns among churners and non-churners.

**Modeling Approach**

Machine learning models used (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, etc.).

Training-testing split and model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC).

**Results & Insights**

Best-performing model and its performance metrics.

Key factors influencing churn based on model interpretation.

**Conclusion & Future Scope**

Business implications of findings.

Possible improvements (feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, advanced models).
